Backend-Blog
============

- We're going to design and implement the back-end for a blog application.
- Implement the models (classes) in the models folder, according to the design
we made in the group discussion.
- Use TDD to test out the methods and associations in your classes

E.g.

> ruby test/author_test.rb --name /"name of your individual test"
